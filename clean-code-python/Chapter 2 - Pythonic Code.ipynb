    "In programming, an idiom is a particular way of writing code in order to perform a specific task. It is something common that repeats and follows the same structure every time. Some could even argue and call them a pattern, but be careful because they are not designed patterns (which we will explore later on). The main difference is that design patterns are high-level ideas, independent from the language (sort of), but they do not translate into code immediately. On the other hand, idioms are actually coded. It is the way things should be written when we want to perform a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As idioms are code, they are language dependent. Every language will have its own idioms, which means the way things are done in that particular language (for example, how you would open and write a file in C, C++, and so on). When the code follows these idioms, it is known as being idiomatic, which in Python is often referred to as Pythonic.\n",

    "There are multiple reasons to follow these recommendations and write Pythonic code first (as we will see and analyze), writing code in an idiomatic way usually performs better. It is also more compact and easier to understand. These are traits that we always want in our code so that it works effectively. Secondly, as introduced in the previous chapter, it is important that the entire development team can get used to the same patterns and structure of the code because this will help them focus on the true essence of the problem, and will help them avoid making mistakes."

For example, on situations when we open files, we want to make sure that they are closed after processing (so we do not leak file descriptors), or if we open a connection to a service (or even a socket), we also want to be sure to close it accordingly, or when removing temporary files, and so on.\n",

On the first line of the context manager, the with statement will call the first method, **\\_\\_enter\\_\\_**, and whatever this method returns will be assigned to the variable labeled after as.

After running the backup, we want to make sure that we start the process again, regardless of how the process of the backup itself went. Now, the first approach would be to create a huge monolithic function that tries to do everything in the same place, stop the service, perform the backup task, handle exceptions and all possible edge cases, and then try to restart the service again. You can imagine such a function, and for that reason, I will spare you the details, and instead come up directly with a possible way of tackling this issue with context managers:"

The second is where this method takes action because the object does not have anything called fallback_test, so the `__getattr__` will run with that value. Inside that method, we placed the code that returns a string, and what we get is the result of that transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example is interesting because there a new attribute named fallback_new is created (actually, this call would be the same as running dyn.fallback_new = \"new value\"), so when we request that attribute, notice that the logic we put in `__getattr__` does not apply, simply because that code is never called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the last example is the most interesting one. There is a subtle detail here that makes a huge difference. Take another look at the code in the `__getattr__` method. Notice the exception it raises when the value is not retrievable `AttributeError`. This is not only for consistency (as well as the message in the exception) but also required by the built-in `getattr()` function. Had this exception been any other, it would raise, and the default value would not be returned.\n",

When we pass a value to it, this will take the place of the default argument we just created.
